# Rebooting network

## Swift Cairo
<I>This code sample has been introduced in the first meetup for SwiftCairo in 9th of May 2018, here's for those who requested it.
  
  updates were made after as I got couple of requests on how this layer makes it easy to replace network lib to original one, so check "Native" branch if you wanted that. 

## Medium blog about it:
